# Smart Wallet ðŸ’³: 

- The Smart Wallet is a decentralized wallet built using the Solidity programming language on the Ethereum blockchain.
- It features a unique allowance mechanism, where the owner of the wallet can set limits on how much can be transferred by any given user.
- This adds an extra layer of security, allowing for greater control over funds. The wallet also includes a voting system, where guardians can vote on changes to the wallet's ownership.
- This allows for a more democratic approach to managing the wallet, ensuring that important decisions are made with the input of multiple trusted individuals.
